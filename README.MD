## Multi-Screen Navigation — Sprint 3.16

DormDesk uses Flutter’s Navigator and named routes to enable navigation between Welcome, Login, Signup, and Home screens.

### Routes Setup

Routes are defined in `main.dart`:

```dart
MaterialApp(
  initialRoute: '/welcome',
  routes: {
    '/welcome': (context) => WelcomeScreen(),
    '/login': (context) => LoginScreen(),
    '/signup': (context) => SignupScreen(),
  },
  onGenerateRoute: (settings) {
    if (settings.name == '/home') {
      final uid = settings.arguments as String;
      return MaterialPageRoute(
        builder: (context) => HomeScreen(uid),
      );
    }
    return null;
  },
);
```

### Navigation Flow

```
WelcomeScreen → LoginScreen → HomeScreen
SignupScreen → HomeScreen
Logout → LoginScreen
```

### Navigator Methods Used

* `Navigator.pushNamed()` – Navigate to another screen
* `Navigator.pushReplacementNamed()` – Replace current screen
* `Navigator.pop()` – Go back
* `onGenerateRoute` – Pass UID to HomeScreen

### Argument Passing Example

```dart
Navigator.pushReplacementNamed(
  context,
  '/home',
  arguments: user.uid,
);
```

### Reflection

Using named routes makes navigation clean, scalable, and easier to manage in larger applications like DormDesk. It also allows safe data transfer between screens.
