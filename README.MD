## Multi-Screen Navigation — Sprint 3.16

DormDesk uses Flutter’s Navigator and named routes to enable navigation between Welcome, Login, Signup, and Home screens.

### Routes Setup

Routes are defined in `main.dart`:

```dart
MaterialApp(
  initialRoute: '/welcome',
  routes: {
    '/welcome': (context) => WelcomeScreen(),
    '/login': (context) => LoginScreen(),
    '/signup': (context) => SignupScreen(),
  },
  onGenerateRoute: (settings) {
    if (settings.name == '/home') {
      final uid = settings.arguments as String;
      return MaterialPageRoute(
        builder: (context) => HomeScreen(uid),
      );
    }
    return null;
  },
);
```

### Navigation Flow

```
WelcomeScreen → LoginScreen → HomeScreen
SignupScreen → HomeScreen
Logout → LoginScreen
```

### Navigator Methods Used

* `Navigator.pushNamed()` – Navigate to another screen
* `Navigator.pushReplacementNamed()` – Replace current screen
* `Navigator.pop()` – Go back
* `onGenerateRoute` – Pass UID to HomeScreen

### Argument Passing Example

```dart
Navigator.pushReplacementNamed(
  context,
  '/home',
  arguments: user.uid,
);
```

### Reflection

Using named routes makes navigation clean, scalable, and easier to manage in larger applications like DormDesk. It also allows safe data transfer between screens.

---

## Responsive Layout Design — Sprint 3.17

A responsive layout was implemented in DormDesk using Flutter’s core layout widgets: Container, Row, and Column. The layout adapts dynamically to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience across mobile and tablet devices.

---

### Layout Structure

The layout consists of three main sections:

* Header Section — Displays DormDesk title
* Main Content Area — Shows panels using Row (tablet) or Column (mobile)
* Footer / Bottom Panel — Additional UI section

---

### Key Widgets Used

**Container**
Used to define structure, spacing, colors, and alignment.

```dart
Container(
  width: double.infinity,
  height: 120,
  color: Colors.blue,
  child: Center(child: Text("DormDesk Header")),
);
```

**Column**
Used for vertical layout on mobile devices.

```dart
Column(
  children: [
    Container(color: Colors.orange),
    Container(color: Colors.green),
  ],
);
```

**Row**
Used for horizontal layout on larger screens.

```dart
Row(
  children: [
    Expanded(child: Container(color: Colors.orange)),
    Expanded(child: Container(color: Colors.green)),
  ],
);
```

---

### Responsive Logic Using MediaQuery

Screen width is detected and layout adjusts automatically:

```dart
double width = MediaQuery.of(context).size.width;
bool isTablet = width > 600;
```

Mobile → Column layout
Tablet → Row layout

---

### Navigation Integration

The responsive layout is accessible via named route:

```dart
Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/responsive');
```

---

### Screenshots

(Add screenshots here)

* Mobile layout (Column)
* Tablet layout (Row)
* Responsive layout transition

---

### Reflection

Responsive design ensures the application works across multiple screen sizes without layout issues. Using Row, Column, Container, and MediaQuery makes the UI flexible, scalable, and adaptable for real-world deployment.
