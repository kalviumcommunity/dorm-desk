## Multi-Screen Navigation — Sprint 3.16

DormDesk uses Flutter’s Navigator and named routes to enable navigation between Welcome, Login, Signup, and Home screens.

### Routes Setup

Routes are defined in `main.dart`:

```dart
MaterialApp(
  initialRoute: '/welcome',
  routes: {
    '/welcome': (context) => WelcomeScreen(),
    '/login': (context) => LoginScreen(),
    '/signup': (context) => SignupScreen(),
  },
  onGenerateRoute: (settings) {
    if (settings.name == '/home') {
      final uid = settings.arguments as String;
      return MaterialPageRoute(
        builder: (context) => HomeScreen(uid),
      );
    }
    return null;
  },
);
```

### Navigation Flow

```
WelcomeScreen → LoginScreen → HomeScreen
SignupScreen → HomeScreen
Logout → LoginScreen
```

### Navigator Methods Used

* `Navigator.pushNamed()` – Navigate to another screen
* `Navigator.pushReplacementNamed()` – Replace current screen
* `Navigator.pop()` – Go back
* `onGenerateRoute` – Pass UID to HomeScreen

### Argument Passing Example

```dart
Navigator.pushReplacementNamed(
  context,
  '/home',
  arguments: user.uid,
);
```

### Reflection

Using named routes makes navigation clean, scalable, and easier to manage in larger applications like DormDesk. It also allows safe data transfer between screens.

---

## Responsive Layout Design — Sprint 3.17

A responsive layout was implemented in DormDesk using Flutter’s core layout widgets: Container, Row, and Column. The layout adapts dynamically to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience across mobile and tablet devices.

---

### Layout Structure

The layout consists of three main sections:

* Header Section — Displays DormDesk title
* Main Content Area — Shows panels using Row (tablet) or Column (mobile)
* Footer / Bottom Panel — Additional UI section

---

### Key Widgets Used

**Container**
Used to define structure, spacing, colors, and alignment.

```dart
Container(
  width: double.infinity,
  height: 120,
  color: Colors.blue,
  child: Center(child: Text("DormDesk Header")),
);
```

**Column**
Used for vertical layout on mobile devices.

```dart
Column(
  children: [
    Container(color: Colors.orange),
    Container(color: Colors.green),
  ],
);
```

**Row**
Used for horizontal layout on larger screens.

```dart
Row(
  children: [
    Expanded(child: Container(color: Colors.orange)),
    Expanded(child: Container(color: Colors.green)),
  ],
);
```

---

### Responsive Logic Using MediaQuery

Screen width is detected and layout adjusts automatically:

```dart
double width = MediaQuery.of(context).size.width;
bool isTablet = width > 600;
```

Mobile → Column layout
Tablet → Row layout

---

### Navigation Integration

The responsive layout is accessible via named route:

```dart
Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/responsive');
```

---

### Screenshots

(Add screenshots here)

* Mobile layout (Column)
* Tablet layout (Row)
* Responsive layout transition

---

### Reflection

Responsive design ensures the application works across multiple screen sizes without layout issues. Using Row, Column, Container, and MediaQuery makes the UI flexible, scalable, and adaptable for real-world deployment.

---
## Scrollable Views with ListView & GridView — Sprint 3.18

This feature demonstrates scrollable layouts in DormDesk using Flutter’s ListView and GridView widgets. These widgets allow efficient display of dynamic and large datasets while maintaining smooth UI performance.

---

### ListView Implementation

ListView.builder is used to display a horizontal scrollable list of hostel-related items.

```dart
SizedBox(
  height: 200,
  child: ListView.builder(
    scrollDirection: Axis.horizontal,
    itemCount: 10,
    itemBuilder: (context, index) {
      return Container(
        width: 150,
        margin: EdgeInsets.all(8),
        color: Colors.blue,
        child: Center(child: Text("Item $index")),
      );
    },
  ),
)
```

This allows efficient rendering by loading only visible elements.

---

### GridView Implementation

GridView.builder is used to display structured hostel service tiles in a grid layout.

```dart
GridView.builder(
  shrinkWrap: true,
  physics: NeverScrollableScrollPhysics(),
  gridDelegate: SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount(
    crossAxisCount: 2,
  ),
  itemCount: 6,
  itemBuilder: (context, index) {
    return Container(
      margin: EdgeInsets.all(8),
      color: Colors.green,
      child: Center(child: Text("Tile $index")),
    );
  },
)
```

This provides an organized and scalable UI.

---

### Navigation

Scrollable views are integrated using named routes:

```dart
Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/scrollable');
```

---

### Benefits

• Efficient rendering using builder constructors
• Smooth scrolling performance
• Scalable for large datasets
• Organized UI layout
• Improved user experience

---

### Reflection

ListView and GridView improve UI efficiency by rendering only visible items, reducing memory usage and improving performance. Builder constructors are recommended for large datasets because they dynamically generate widgets as needed instead of loading everything at once.

This implementation prepares DormDesk for displaying dynamic hostel issues, notifications, and service dashboards efficiently.
---
## Responsive Design using MediaQuery and LayoutBuilder — Sprint 3.23

Implemented adaptive UI using MediaQuery and LayoutBuilder.

MediaQuery was used to detect screen width and height.

LayoutBuilder was used to switch between mobile and tablet layouts.

Mobile layout uses Column structure.

Tablet layout uses Row structure.

This ensures DormDesk UI adapts smoothly across all screen sizes.
